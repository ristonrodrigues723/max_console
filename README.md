this is a raspi zero 2w based console that would run on retropie and should be abl to run emukate most consoles as ninto ds , gba gb color psx, and even psp is raspi 0 is overcolcked 
this is my last project. i optimized the bom to be the best the i could these are the cheapest available items non amazon from offical retailers for raspi and screen,
im setting up teh code to set up the buttons mine has 18-20 buttons like psp so it could emultat thise games and using adafruit button script for rwetripie i dhiuld be abke to set up most other consoles too
the touch would only work for ninto ds
