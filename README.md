This is my latest project: a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W-based console running on RetroPie. I've optimized the Bill of Materials (BOM) to include the best and cheapest available items from official retailers for the Raspberry Pi and screen.
When overclocked(necessary for psp), this console should be able to emulate most systems, including Nintendo DS, Game Boy Advance (GBA), Game Boy Color (GBC), PlayStation (PSX), and even some (PSP games.
I am currently setting up the code for the buttons. My design incorporates 18-20 buttons, similar to a PSP, allowing for accurate emulation of those games. By utilizing the Adafruit button script for RetroPie, I anticipate being able to configure controls for most other consoles as well.
The touch functionality will be specifically for Nintendo DS emulation
